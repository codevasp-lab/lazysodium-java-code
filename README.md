# Why this Fork

This fork was created to support latest libsodium library, since original repo is not being updated anymore.
Since, this is meant to be used for CODE travel rule and server environment, supported binaries are Linux ARM64, AMD64(
X86) only.
For the local development environment, Mac ARM(M CPU) is supported.

It should work with Springboot 3.2+ as well.

We will regularly update latest libsodium library from [Libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium).

libsodium 1.0.20 stable

https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases/tag/1.0.20-RELEASE
